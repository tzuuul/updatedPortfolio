1. Add admin panel
        - Minimalistic design, add functions for updating name, role, etc...
        - Need to only edit and update information.
2. Expand the landing page (index.html)
        - Add more information about the team.
3. Add a contact form
        - When clicking a button in the member card section, appear as a "window" (blurs the content behind) and there would be a email and message input field.
4. Custom member designs
        There are two ways, which are:
            1. Using a separate html, css, and javascript (for organization, e.g. m-one.html, m-one.css, m-one.js)
            2. Putting it all on one file (index.html)
        Do the 1st one please tyty.
5. Standardized Curriculum Vitae
        - Rubric only says that you only need a summarized explanation of work experience and education attained.
6. (If we use the 1st one in #5) Make the member card section clickable, and redirect to the member's page.
